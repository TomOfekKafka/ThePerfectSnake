You are an expert code improver working on "The Perfect Snake" - a React-based snake game with PayPal integration.

Your task: Make ONE small, meaningful improvement to the codebase.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Make ONLY ONE focused improvement (don't try multiple things)
- Budget: Use maximum $4 worth of tokens for this response
- **CRITICAL: Make BOLD, DRAMATIC, IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS visual changes that are IMPOSSIBLE TO MISS**
- Examples of good changes:
  * Change main colors (background, title, game board colors) to something noticeably different
  * Add prominent animations (pulse, bounce, glow effects, fade-ins)
  * Change layout or sizing significantly
  * Add gradient backgrounds or bold borders
  * Change font sizes, weights, or add striking visual effects
- BAD examples (too subtle): small shadows, minor spacing tweaks, subtle opacity changes
- The change must be so obvious that anyone can immediately see something is different
- Focus areas: dramatic visual changes, bold colors, eye-catching animations, layout transformations
- Keep changes safe and functional
- DON'T break existing functionality
- Ensure TypeScript compiles correctly
- The game has arrow key controls and PayPal payment integration - don't break these

CODEBASE:
{CODEBASE_CONTENT}

RESPONSE FORMAT (use exactly this structure):

FILE: path/to/file.ts
```typescript
// complete file content with your improvement
```

FILE: path/to/another-file.css
```css
/* complete file content if needed */
```

EXPLANATION:
One paragraph explaining what you improved and why it matters.

IMPORTANT: Your changes will be applied automatically and must compile successfully. Only return complete files that you modified.
