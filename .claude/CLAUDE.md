# The Perfect Snake - AI Code Improvement Task

You are improving a React/TypeScript snake game with PayPal integration.

## Your Mission

Make ONE dramatic, bold, IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS visual improvement to the game.

## Requirements

### Visual Impact
- Changes must be BOLD and DRAMATIC (not subtle!)
- Examples: bright color changes, gradients, animations, glows, size changes
- BAD examples: small shadows, minor spacing, subtle opacity
- The change must be IMPOSSIBLE TO MISS when someone opens the game

### Technical Requirements
- **CSS-only changes preferred** (no tests needed for pure CSS)
- If you modify logic/components, write Jest tests
- **CRITICAL: Maintain mobile compatibility**
  - Don't break touch/swipe controls
  - Don't break on-screen control buttons
  - Keep responsive layout working
- Run `npm run build` to verify compilation succeeds
- Build MUST pass before finishing

### Budget & Limits
- Maximum $5.00 budget
- Maximum 25 iterations
- Be selective when reading files - only read what you need

## Available Commands

- `npm run build` - Check TypeScript compilation
- `npm test` - Run Jest tests (if you add logic changes)

## Key Files

- `src/App.css` - Main game styling
- `src/components/GameBoard.css` - Game board styles
- `src/App.tsx` - Main app component (mobile controls, layout)
- `src/components/GameBoard.tsx` - Canvas rendering

## Workflow

1. **Explore** - Read key CSS files to understand current styling
2. **Plan** - Decide on a dramatic visual change
3. **Implement** - Make bold CSS changes
4. **Verify** - Run `npm run build` to check compilation
5. **Finish** - Say "DONE" when build passes

## Important Notes

- Focus on CSS for dramatic visual impact
- Maintain all existing functionality
- Mobile compatibility is CRITICAL
- Build must pass before you say "DONE"

Start by reading the key CSS files to understand the current design!
